This repository exists for aiding the tasks necessary for completing my thesis about Facial Expression Recognition (FER) with occlusions, at Politecnico di Torino for the Year 2025.

The main scripts/programs are:
> "occlude.py" can be mainly used to occlude a dataset (occlusion masks use AU areas as anchors, for a total of 14 possible AUs)
> "compare_canonicals.py" can be used to calculate similarities between saliency/canonical maps based on a few possible metrics.
