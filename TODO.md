Machine Learning

1) Run new test set
    * ~~make an h5py file ~~
        * or just modify load_data_and_labels() but I don't think it's best to use the h5py format
    * correct all folders paths that point to Federica's Drive
    * fallo funzionare in qualche maniera per dio

2) Create occlusion augmentations 
    * run them either online or make a spare set
